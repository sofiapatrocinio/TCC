  The Multilind application is an app developed by students during the Software Development Methods and Software Product Engineering courses of the Software Engineering program at the University of Brasília - Campus Gama, 
  by nine members, including the author of this monography, under the MIT license. It also has the partnership of Professor Altaci Corrêa Rubim, the Brazilian representative of the World Working Group of the Decade 
  of Indigenous Languages, and members of the Brazilian Working Group. Its goal is to map the indigenous languages present in Brazil and provide information about these languages, such as the language family and 
  language trunk, language words, their translations in both formal Portuguese and indigenous languages, and related images. After gathering feedback from stakeholders, challenges related to usability and user experience 
  in the Multilind application have been identified. Based on these raised concerns, this study aims to explore how the application of usability and user experience best practices can contribute to improvements in these aspects. 
  To achieve this, the Multilind application has been used as a case study to understand user perceptions of the current version of the app. Using these perceptions, an improvement plan to identify demands has been developed 
  in the form of a high-fidelity prototype. Following user validations, additional enhancements will be implemented in the application. Given the above, it is expected 
  that this work will provide improvements in terms of user satisfaction, engagement, and ease of use of the Multilind application.
